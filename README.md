### Seo speach
It was in company dev speach to familiarize team members with the SEO. [Here](structured.md) lays speach structure... It was my first speach and in future I'll pay more attention to speach blocks size - they should fit in to the slide-\_-  

#### Maybe table of contents will come handy...
- [What influencing on SEO](structured.md#what-influencing-on-seo)
- [What to do with that knowledge](structured.md#now-when-we-know-what-influencing-on-seo-what-can-we-do-with-it)
- [Chaotic possible SEO for our project](structured.md#possible-data)=)
- [Pages hierarchy(more stable=)](structured.md#pages-hierarchy)
